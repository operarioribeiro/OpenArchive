## Open Archive

**Open Archive** is the application of open source technologies and archivologic biblioteconomic library information science (LIS) to the management of files in any size and degree of complexity. It is based on the [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) research [Open Archive Management](https://www.academia.edu/144448058/Open_Archive).

##  Open Filename:

Files Names are to be organized in the following way to improve their [human readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-readable_medium_and_data), [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility), and [self-explanation](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/self-explanatory):

**Historical Files Name:** Year.Month. Name of The File - Author of the File.[filetype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_file_format)

**Historical Files Example:** 2025.10. Open Archive - Felipe Ribeiro.odt

**Hierarchical Files Name:** Number. Name of the File - Author of the File.[filetype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_file_format)

**Hierarchical Files Example:** 1. Open Archive - Felipe Ribeiro.odt

##  Open Directory Structure:

Folders and Files being ordered by the year and month dates or hierarchy numbers in front of their name allow for their better organization. I propose the following [data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure) [alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment):
